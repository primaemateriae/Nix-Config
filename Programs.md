# Program Collection

## Criterion

A language is counted if it constitutes at least 5% of the program, unless if no single language satisfies this criterion (which would be rare, but will be noted as an exception. Language statistics
are rounded to whole numbers not only for simplicity, but also to account for the fact that specefic percentages should shift overtime as projects evolve. Since data is currently mangually entered,
the accuracy of such numbers may drift over time, and should be amended from time to time. Moreover, due to the rounding, the percentages of languages may add up to be under or over 100%. The
languages section can also include notable frameworks, such as the graphics framework for a GUI (e.g. GTK, Qt, Electron)
